**Time Series Stock Prediction 📈💹**
Welcome to the Time Series Stock Prediction repository! This project utilizes time series forecasting, neural networks, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict the stock prices. In this repository, you will find two essential files:

TimeSeriesStock.ipynb
This Jupyter Notebook file contains the code for predicting stock prices using time series forecasting techniques, neural networks, and LSTMs. Feel free to explore the notebook, run the code cells, and experiment with different parameters to enhance your understanding of stock price prediction.

AMZN.csv
The AMZN.csv file contains the complete historical stock price data for Amazon. This dataset serves as the input for the TimeSeriesStock.ipynb notebook. It includes various columns such as Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, and Adjusted Close, providing comprehensive information to train and test the predictive models.
Getting Started 🚀

Follow these steps to get started with the stock price prediction:

Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/TimeSeriesStockPrediction.git

Open the TimeSeriesStock.ipynb notebook using Jupyter or any compatible environment.

Run the code cells sequentially and experiment with different parameters for a better understanding of stock price prediction.

Requirements 🛠️
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Scikit-Learn
